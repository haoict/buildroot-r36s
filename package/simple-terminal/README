st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple virtual terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

Modified to run on RS-97.
=> line doubling to deal with the 320x480 resolution
=> TTF fonts replaced by embedded pixel font (from TIC-80)
=> onscreen keyboard (see keyboard.c for button bindings)

Keys: 
- pad: select key
- A: press key
- B: toggles key (useful for shift/ctrl...)
- L: is shift
- R: is backspace
- Y: change keyboard location (top/bottom)
- X: show / hide keyboard
- SELECT: quit


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

Build
------------
For generic linux:
    make

For RG35XX Plus:
    ./build-rg35xxplus.sh
    (or run inside rg35xxplus-toolchain docker container: UNION_PLATFORM=rg35xxplus make)

For generic linux (with bigger window size)
    UNION_PLATFORM=upscale make


Running st
----------

    ./build/SimpleTerminal

Run with High resolution
    HIGH_RES=1 ./build/SimpleTerminal


If you don't install st, define TNAME to "xterm" in config.h or make sure to at
least compile st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -s st.info

It should print the path of the compiled terminfo entry. You can
safely remove it if you don't plan to use st anymore.
See the man page for additional details.
